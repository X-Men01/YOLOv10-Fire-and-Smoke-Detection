<h1 align="center"><span>Data</span></h1> 

The dataset used for this project consists of images containing fire and smoke,primarily collected from [Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com). To ensure the quality and reliability of the dataset, we performed an extensive data cleaning process using the [cleanvision](https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanvision) library.
#### Data Cleaning Process
The data cleaning process was thoroughly documented in a Jupyter notebook. You can find the notebook, which includes all the code and results, [here](https://github.com/X-Men01/YOLOv10-Fire-and-Smoke-Detection/blob/main/clean_dataset_with_cleanvision_libary.ipynb).
